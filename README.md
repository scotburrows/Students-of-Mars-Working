Students of Mars is a tower defense game. That means that you are going to be placing “towers” next to a path and alien enemies are going to move down that path. Your goal is to place the towers strategically in such a way that you are able to defeat all the enemies as they come. If too many enemies make it past you, you lose.

Each tower costs money. Each tower’s cost and name is shown underneath it. You earn coins for defeating enemies. You can place a tower by clicking on it in the side menu, then clicking on the map where you want to place it. The game ends after you defeat the boss, who appears in wave 10.

There are four types of towers available to buy from the side-bar: guntowers, which are relatively simple and cheap, flamethrowers, which send constant flames towards enemies in a short range, snipers, which can shoot enemies from anywhere on the map, and rocket towers, whose rockets cause an explosion hitting multiple enemies. Clicking on a tower on the map will show its details on the side bar, where you can also refund the tower to get half its cost back, move the tower for the price of half its total cost, and pay for upgrades to increase its stats.

There are two maps to select, the first with one path, and the second having two paths. Different types of aliens will come down these paths in 10 different rounds, requiring the player to be strategic about how to spend their money on towers and upgrades.
